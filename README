Installing Tigger
-----------------

1. Prerequisites

* Assorted python packages: PyQt4, PyQwt5, pyfits, numpy, scipy, astLib.
With the exception of astLib, these are already present in most Linux
distros.  astLib may be downloaded here: http://astlib.sourceforge.net/

* Purr/Kittens. Easiest to install the purr package from a MeqTrees binary
distribution (see http://www.astron.nl/meqwiki/Downloading). Alternatively, 
check it out from svn (see below), and make sure the parent 
of the Kittens directory is in your PYTHONPATH.

2. Getting Tigger

  For a bleeding-edge version:

    svn co svn://lofar9.astron.nl/var/svn/repos/trunk/Tigger
    svn co svn://lofar9.astron.nl/var/svn/repos/trunk/Purr/Kittens

  For a release version:

    svn co svn://lofar9.astron.nl/var/svn/repos/release/Tigger/release-x.y.z/Tigger
    svn co svn://lofar9.astron.nl/var/svn/repos/release/Tigger/release-x.y.z/Kittens

3. Running Tigger

  Run Tigger/bin/tigger. There's a number of other useful utilities under Tigger/bin, so maybe put this whole directory in your PATH (or make symlinks to them from somewhere.)
  Note that these scripts contain some cleverness to locate the parent Tigger directory 
  (the cleverness consists of taking ../.. actually), so don't copy them -- symlink them. To be precise, they:

    * try import Tigger
    * if that fails, they add ../.. (relative to their location) to sys.path and try again.

  So if you do want to copy the scripts somewhere, make sure that the parent of Tigger is in PYTHONPATH, so that the first option works.

  If you want a sky model to play with, check one of my purrlogs, e.g.

  http://www.astron.nl/meqwiki-data/users/oms/3C147/3C147-2006obs.purrlog/index.html

  This will contain an .MDL file you can download (see the first or second
  entry), and also a bunch of FITS files of the same area of the sky.
