Installing Tigger
-----------------

1. Prerequisites

* Assorted python packages: PyQt4, PyQwt5, pyfits, numpy, scipy, astLib. With the exception of astLib, these are already present in most Linux distros. astLib may be downloaded here: http://astlib.sourceforge.net/

* Purr/Kittens. Easiest to install the purr package from a MeqTrees binary distribution (see http://www.astron.nl/meqwiki/Downloading). Alternatively, check it out from svn:

  svn co svn://lofar9.astron.nl/var/svn/repos/trunk/Purr/Kittens

...and make sure the Kittens directory is in your PYTHONPATH.

2. Getting Tigger

  svn co svn://lofar9.astron.nl/var/svn/repos/trunk/Tigger

  This retrieves the latest version from svn. If the need arises, I'll switch to some kind of semi-official release system later.

3. Running Tigger

  Run Tigger/tigger, that's all. You may pass it FITS files or sky model files 
  as command-line arguments. 

  If you want a sky model to play with, check one of my purrlogs, e.g.

  http://www.astron.nl/meqwiki-data/users/oms/3C147/3C147-2006obs.purrlog/index.html

  This will contain an .MDL file you can download (see the first or second entry), and also a bunch of FITS files of the same area of the sky.

4. Questions or problems?

  Just e-mail me.

Have fun,
